I'm Kyaw Ye Thu, a junior undergraduate at the [School of Computing](https://soc.kaist.ac.kr/) of [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/kr/). I grew up playing football in muddy fields and computer games in Myanmar.

My focus in CS has been mostly AI in general. Currently, I'm exploring system for AI to accelerate training models and visual computing to create virtual environments for education and entertainment purpose. In other words, I'm interested in tackling intelligence and graphics-related problems from the persepctives of both hardware and algorithms.

I'm a huge fan of footballâš½ and story-driven RPGsðŸŽ®. Story telling whether through digital content like a video game or theatrical performanceðŸŽ­ is an art that deeply captivates me. There're now fewer opportunities for performing arts like I had in high school, but I'd always love to perform activities that somehow engage with an audience. Sometimes, I also tend to consolidate my thoughts into a piece of writing, some of which you can find in [Writing](https://kyaw-yethu.github.io/writing/).

Before coming to Korea, I voluntarily taught young teenagers about introductory programming and AI as well as helped organize a national hackathon at [Thate Pan Hub](https://thatepanhub.org/), an educational enterprise from Myanmar. The best part was I learned to enjoy working with a group of passionate people with the same mission. So, reach out to me if you want to find ways to work together, whether about a software product, a research topic, a social initiative or anything else!
